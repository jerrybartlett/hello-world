# hello-world
Time-honoured first repository exercise
Although I've been using git a fair amout over the years, it's nearly a year since I used git at Kollmorgen and even longer since GitHub at Qlik.
Now I'm going to be documenting APIs at Peach, it seems likely I will be using repositories again.
Shouldn't take me very long to get back into the swing of things.
